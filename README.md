PlacePicker App


Description
PlacePicker App arranges stored places based on your coordinates. For example, if you are in the USA, the nearest location in the dataset, such as the Grand Canyon, will appear first.

This project demonstrates frontend development using React and backend development using Node.js. The backend uses a dummy data storage setup where data is stored locally in JSON format. The app showcases essential CRUD operations: fetching, updating, deleting, and storing data from the backend.

Features

Dynamic data fetching, updating, and deletion from a local backend
Backend data stored in JSON format for demonstration purposes
Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js
